# libroguelike

Simple single-header game library in ANSI C with zero dependencies. Most
useful for roguelike devs, but has functionality that should be useful to most
2d tile-based games.

See the examples folder - examples/bsp.c is a minimal example for dungeon
generation and examples/fov.c includes FOV and basic player movement.

Note that the interface is considered unstable. This is in its very early
stages, but should be usable as-is. Once I push a tagged release the code API
should be more stable.
